/**
 * normalize_anthropic_tool_ids adapter
 *
 * Rewrites `tool_use` / `tool_result` identifiers inside an Anthropic Messages
 * body so they satisfy Anthropic's tool-id charset constraint
 * `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *
 * Anthropic rejects any tool id outside that charset with a hard HTTP 400, e.g.
 * `messages.222.content.1.tool_use.id: String should match pattern
 * '^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$'`. Plenty of foreign providers mint ids that violate it —
 * Moonshot/Kimi emits `functions.WebSearch:3`, pi-ai replays composite
 * `call_x|fc_y` ids, and Gemini uses the dotted tool name as the id. Those ids
 * reach an Anthropic-shaped body through two separate routes:
 *
 *   1. The messages -> messages pass-through, where the dispatcher forwards a
 *      verbatim deep clone of the client body (`request-payload-builder.ts`)
 *      and `transformers/anthropic/request-builder.ts` never runs at all. A
 *      client that accumulated foreign ids in an earlier turn replays them
 *      here untouched.
 *   2. Cross-format transforms, which carry the upstream id straight across
 *      from `tool_calls[].id` / `tool_call_id`.
 *
 * Why proactive rather than reactive (strip-and-retry on the 400):
 *
 *   - Claude-Code masking computes its billing signature during
 *     `prepareNativeOAuthDispatch`, which runs *after* adapters. Mutating the
 *     body post-signing would invalidate that signature, so the rewrite has to
 *     happen up front.
 *   - Failover cannot rescue the request either: every Anthropic
 *     messages-format target enforces the same charset, so the identical body
 *     400s on each attempt.
 *
 * Where it is injected: `adapter-resolver.ts` adds this adapter implicitly only
 * when the outbound wire format is Anthropic Messages AND the target looks like
 * Anthropic (anthropic.com base URL, Anthropic OAuth, or Claude masking) —
 * other Messages-speaking proxies do not enforce the charset. A provider- or
 * model-level `adapter` entry overrides that either way
 * (`{ name, options: {}, enabled: true }` to force it on, `{ name, enabled:
 * false }` to opt out).
 *
 * (Same decision rule as the NOTE in
 * `suppress-unsupported-gpt5-options.adapter.ts`: strip statically when every
 * upstream on the path rejects the shape, reactively when only some do.)
 *
 * Outbound (preDispatch): rewrites offending ids in place and emits one warn
 * summarising the count. Ids already inside the charset — including Anthropic's
 * own `toolu_` / `srvtoolu_` ids of any length — are never touched.
 *
 * Inbound (postDispatch) and stream hooks: no-op. This is a request-side-only
 * repair, and adapters run in reverse on the way back, so identity is correct.
